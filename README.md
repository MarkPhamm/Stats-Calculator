## Overview
[Click here to access the app](https://stats-calculator.streamlit.app/)


Welcome to the **Statistic Calculator** app! This Streamlit-powered application provides a comprehensive suite of statistical tools and models for data analysis, hypothesis testing, and machine learning. The app is divided into several sections, covering both discrete and continuous distributions, margin of error (MOE) calculations, hypothesis tests, statistical theorems, and machine learning models.

Whether you're looking to explore binomial distributions, run hypothesis tests, or apply machine-learning techniques like gradient descent, this app has you covered!
